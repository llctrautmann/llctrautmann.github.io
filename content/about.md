Welcome to my reserach blog. I am mainly interested in the intersection of generative modelling and inverse problems in the biomedical imaging domain. The rest is posts and art that I have written in different phases of my journey.

You can reach me at [llct.general@proton.me](mailto:llct.general@proton.me).
