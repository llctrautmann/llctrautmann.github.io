title: 'The i-th day'

I think the really difficult thing about chronic diseases is not the disease itself. It is the need to accept the inevitability of its permanence. More specifically, it is the feeling to not be able to cope with it on the i-th day. It is not difficult to live with an alignment for one day, it is not difficult to live with an alignment for 100 days. But it is very difficult to live with an alignment forever. No resource is permanent. And these suckers are very good at grinding you down. 

An adjacent issue with cronicity in diseases is the loneliness that they come with. It is so, so difficult to make someone else understand what it feels like to have a problem for the 1593rd day. I can describe you my symptomes, but the human brain operates in moments not in stretches of time. Memories are images and not movies. Try to make someone emotionally understand how the past five years felt. It’s not really possible. So as much as people want to be empathetic, if you don’t have experienced something similar in your life, chances are high that I won’t be able to share the real pain with you. That makes it very difficult to shoulder the burden together. It makes me feel lonely and hopeless sometimes. 

I think the only way forward is to accept your situation more and more and give up on the past version of you that is not there anymore. But that is very difficult. I am fighting my battle for 7 years now. That is 2500 days roughly. My issue is some perception problem in my brain that gives me a tinnitus and a bunch of visual distortion. 
I don’t even remember what silence is or how the world looks like without the after images or static noise, but I still miss the past. Everyday I miss the past. I don’t want to be pitied, that is not the point here. It does gets better and time does heal you a bit but only very slowly and because it is chronic never fully. That is kind of the tough reality. 

My advice to others with someone who has a chronic issue in their life would be the following: Ask them about the stuff that happens around their illness, the desperation, the fear, the loneliness. Let them open up, they are all fighting a battle everyday. I can talk about myself, its is not the symptom that is make it difficult. It is the stymptome on day 1593, after 1592 days of having the symptome. It is the griding down of resources and energy. Thst’s the really difficult bit. 

I could of course be wrong with my assessment here and its a breezer for most people. But it is not for me and I think I am not the only one with these feelings. 

Stay safe out there and take care of each other; that’s half of the game.
