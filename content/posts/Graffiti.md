Writing something, somewhere in a public place has always been a go-to tool for those without any other means of resistance to stick it to the current regime. But since the advent of nano-tech coatings and fast clean-up drones, spray and paint have lost their “fuck-the-system” value. But the world keeps spinning and scientific knowledge generally doesn’t want to be tied up like a hooker too careless to agree to some mild bondage play up in the back alley brothels on the soft underbelly of Tokyos shadow world. Now the tool of choice is microbial bio-paint. A mixture of a calcium-rich deployment substrate and lab engineered bacteria that have all but two functions spliced from their genetic composition.
The first converts the deployment fuel into highly corrosive fluorinated acid that decomposes anything including hardened glass into a workable canvas to spread “the message”. The second, is a highly optimised gene expression protocol that recombines the available molecules from the canvas and the deployment substrate into a almost indestructible calcium-silicate crust, that remains of a surface longer than the time humans have populated rock-3.
Put the fully enriched mixture anywhere and within seconds the gene edited cells will engrave themselves into the surface. Used carefully, you can write anything anywhere and make sure it remains there to be seen until the surface gets demolished. More expensive versions also embed any combination of fluorescence particles into the mix to make artists mental arithmetics against the system pop even more.

The flipside of this artistic superpower are the large wounds straight to the bone you obtain when you as much as get a drop of the deployment solution onto bare skin. The images of unfortunate early-adopters with gaping holes in their arms and legs, when the bio-paint hit the market first will permanently live in anyones brain rent-free. It is also - naturally - very illegal and if you get caught with it permanent disapperance is the most likely outcome.
