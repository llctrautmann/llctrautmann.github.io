## Definitions
$$a = bx$$

This is an inline \(a^*=x-b^*\) equation.

These are block equations:

\[a^*=x-b^*\]

\[ a^*=x-b^* \]

\[
a^*=x-b^*
\]

These are also block equations:

$$a^*=x-b^*$$

$$ a^*=x-b^* $$

$$
a^*=x-b^*
$$


## Issues with the Kernel

So we have seen that the simple equation
\[
y = ax + e
\]
is able to describe a lot of interesting problems that we encounter. MRI acceleration is one of them.

```python
for i in range(20):
    print(i)
```
